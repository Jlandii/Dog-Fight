## Features
- A Starship player character
	- Im going to use turtle and pygame to run the game and give the player inputs, movement, and health.
- Enemy starships for the player to fight
	- Im going to create objects / classes that are spawned randomly that will "battle" the player
- Im going to have a score system and a lives system  
	- Everytime the player defeats an enemy ship they will game points, if they are hit they will "die", respawn and loose points.

## Challenges
- Adding my own sprites / animations
- Adding things like enemy attacks 
- Adding more complicated actions for the player like alternate attacks or a speed boost of some kind 
- Adding powerups or other hazards

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- have a game where the player can fly around fighting with enemy AI. They will have access to mulitple forms of weapons and even have ally ships. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The player can fly around fighting enemy AI with basic movment and 1 main attack. The enemy AI wont neccesarily attack the player, but the game will have my own art and animations as well as additional hazards.
